\section{Introduction}
    NGHam is a protocol set for packet based amateur radio, intended to resolve some issues with
    currently used protocols AX.25 and KISS. Its key features are:

    \begin{description}
        \item[Very robust:] Allows decoding with much lower SNR compared to 1200 baud AFSK AX.25 due to the 
        use of a sync word with good autocorrelation properties and Reed Solomon FEC over the whole
        remaining packet.
        \item[High throughput:] Due to the short preamble and increased chance of successful packet reception,
        the practical throughput will be much higher than when using AX.25.
        \item[Better spectral efficiency:] Significantly better spectral efficiency than 1200 baud AFSK, and
        somewhat better than 9600 baud G3RUH modulation due to the reduced deviation.
    \end{description}

    NGHam can be divided into three sub-protocols: NGHam RF, SPP (Serial Port Protocol) and Extension.

\section{Radio Protocol}
    The structure of an NGHam radio packet is shown below.

    \end{figure}

    \begin{description}
        \item[Preamble:] The preamble is short, and is transmitted while the PA is ramping up and the receiver AGC
        is stabilizing. Will vary with symbol rate, but 4 bytes is typically used for 9600 baud.
        Sync word for bit- and packet-synchronization: A 32-bit correlation tag / sync word allows both bit-
        synchronization and detection of packet start in very short time and in very low S/N conditions. This
        means the preamble can be drastically reduced from the order of 100 ms as we typically see for
        AX.25 today, down to under 5 ms - depending on how fast the hardware can switch to transmission.
        This also increases the chance of detecting the packet start substantially.

        \item[Size tag:] A 24 bit tag identifies one out of 7 possible code word sizes. This is made very robust by
        keeping a hamming distance of 13 bits between all vectors.

        \item[Code block:] NGHam uses Reed Solomon block error correction to make it robust against bursts of
        errors. NGHam has no inner convolutional error correction, and this was decided to increase
        throughput at the cost of a somewhat higher SNR margin. Reed Solomon is a robust error correction
        scheme with no restrictions on usage (as opposed to eg. many turbo codes), and Phil Karn, KA9Q,
        provides an open source C-implementation with LGPL licensing (\url{http://www.ka9q.net/code/fec/}).
        Reed Solomon has a fixed block size, so some different methods for allowing variable packet sizes were evaluated.
        Initially a preceding 12 bit length field with a (12,24) golay FEC allowing a variable
        packet length down to a single byte was tested, but this turned out to reduce the robustness due to
        it only being capable of correcting single bit errors. The final solution was to allow seven differently
        sized code blocks identified by a size tag. The transmitter chooses the smallest code block that can fit
        the payload to be sent, and the remaining bytes are padded. This allows higher robustness than the
        first method at a cost of a 0-31 byte overhead.

        \item[Scrambling:] K9NG polynomial scrambling has served well for 9k6 AX.25 packet in many years, but
        unfortunately it cannot be used with most FEC-schemes as errors propagate throughout the packet.
        XOR-ing the data with a fixed sequence at encoding and decoding allows zero delay, synchronization
        with packet start, and no propagating errors. The polynomial used for generating the table is x\^{}8 +
        x\^{}7 + x\^{}5 + x\^{}3 + 1 (as of CCSDS 101.0-B-3).

        \item[Modulation:] GMSK modulation with bt=0.5 should be used. 9600 baud 2-GMSK is the default rate,
        but combinations of 4800, 9600 and 19200 baud symbol rate at 2-GMSK and 4-GMSK are all valid. At
        4-GMSK the preamble and sync word should be transmitted using 2-GMSK.

        \item[Channel access:] Due to the very different uses, CSMA should work as the default access scheme.
        However, the channel access could be changed depending on the next layer protocol. For example, a
        positioning protocol with regular short transmissions of pretty much the same length, such as APRS,
        should use a TDMA-derived scheme. This will allow a lot more efficient channel usage than when using CSMA.
        For transferring bigger amounts of data between a few people, a MACA-scheme with RTS/CTS
        packets as described by Phil Karn could be the most efficient method, but none of this is
        implemented as of today.

        \item[Continous transmission:] All NGHam devices should supports continuous transmission and reception
        (ring buffers are used where needed) by stacking packets end-to-end.

\section{Serial Port Protocol}
    This chapter describes the protocol used to transfer data and commands between the transceiver
    and the serial port host.

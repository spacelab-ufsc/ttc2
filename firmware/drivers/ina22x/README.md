# INA22x Driver

The INA226 is a current shunt and power monitor with an I2C (or SMBUS-compatible) interface. The device monitors both a shunt voltage drop and bus supply voltage. Programmable calibration value, conversion times, and averaging, combined with an internal multiplier, enable direct readouts of current in amperes and power in watts.

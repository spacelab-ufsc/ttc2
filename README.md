## Overview

The TTC (or TT&C) is the second generation communication module of the CubeSats from SpaceLab. It is responsible to make the communication between the earth (a ground station) and a satellite, and is divided in two sub-modules: Beacon and downlink/uplink.

## License

This project is open-source under three different licenses: GNU General Public License v3.0 for firmware sources, CERN Open Hardware License v2.0 for hardware files, and CC BY-SA 4.0 for the documentation. Some third-part files and libraries are subjected to their specific terms and licenses.

## Releases

The TTC 2.0 software and hardware releases are synchronized in order to garantee compatibility. Then, using diferent versions might lead to unpredictable behavior. Refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/ttc2/tree/master/doc) for compatibility notes.
